MUSCLE 3 Road Map
=================

1. Implement logging server side

    * MMP logging call
    * Manager Logger component
    * Unit tests and Continuous Integration
    * Documentation build
    * Linting

2. Implement logging client side

    * LibMuscle logging API
    * Initial MMP Client

MUSCLE 3 Use Case Road Map
==========================

These use cases are probably far too few, but I hope Mark and Lourens can add more of them, or change them around to make the progression more natural?

1. MUSCLE2 App with Two coupled submodels, running each within the same work station.
2. MUSCLE2 App with Three coupled submodels, running each within the same work station.
3. MUSCLE2 App with Two coupled submodels, running on different nodes (using TCP communication)
4. MUSCLE2 App with Three coupled submodels, running on different nodes (using TCP communication)
5. MUSCLE2 App with Two coupled submodels, running on different nodes (using MPI communication)
6. MUSCLE2 App with Three coupled submodels, running on different sites (using TCP/MPWide communication)
